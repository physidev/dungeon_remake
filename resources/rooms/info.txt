I. File Headers
The files must start with three strings:
1) "rm"
2) width of room
3) height of room

Ex. rm 25 20
This encodes a 25 x 20 room

II. Content
The room's content is indicated by the id of each
tile in the room (A guide is provided). The only
requirement is that each id be separated by a space.

Ex. 2 2 2 2 2
    2 4 4 4 2
    2 2 2 2 2

III. Special Characters
A dot "." is used to indicate a tile that is not
replaced. Furthermore, any string containing
"_" terminates the parser.

IV. Guide
. = skip
- = terminate
0 = dirt
1 = gray brick
2 = wall brick
